# Resolution

> How markets are resolved and winning positions redeemed

When the outcome of an event becomes known, the market is **resolved**. Resolution determines which outcome won, allowing holders of winning tokens to redeem them for \$1 each. Losing tokens become worthless.

Polymarket uses the **UMA Optimistic Oracle** for decentralized, permissionless resolution. Anyone can propose an outcome, and anyone can dispute it if they believe it's incorrect.

## Resolution Rules

Every market has pre-defined resolution rules that specify:

* **Resolution source** — Where the outcome will be determined from (e.g., official announcements, specific websites)
* **End date** — When the market is eligible for resolution
* **Edge cases** — How ambiguous situations should be handled

<Warning>
  Always read the resolution rules before trading. The market title describes
  the question, but the **rules** define how it resolves.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Proposal">
    Anyone can propose a resolution by:

    1. Selecting the winning outcome
    2. Posting a bond (typically \$750 USDC.e)
    3. Submitting the proposal to the UMA Oracle

    If the proposal is correct and undisputed, the proposer receives their bond back plus a reward.

    <Warning>
      If you propose incorrectly or too early, you lose your entire bond. Only
      propose if you're confident in the outcome and understand the process.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Challenge Period">
    After a proposal, there's a **2-hour challenge period** where anyone can dispute the outcome.

    * **If no dispute**: The proposal is accepted and the market resolves
    * **If disputed**: A new proposal round begins. If the second proposal is also disputed, the resolution escalates to UMA's DVM (Data Verification Mechanism) for a token holder vote.

    There are three possible resolution flows:

    1. **No dispute** — Propose then Resolve (fastest, \~2 hours)
    2. **One dispute** — Propose, Challenge, second Propose, Resolve (second proposal accepted)
    3. **Two disputes** — Propose, Challenge, second Propose, second Challenge, Resolve via DVM vote
  </Step>

  <Step title="Dispute - If Challenged">
    To dispute a proposal:

    1. Post a counter-bond (same amount as proposer, typically \$750)
    2. The dispute triggers a new proposal round, or if already in the second round, a debate period

    During the **24-48 hour debate period**, evidence can be submitted in UMA's Discord channels (`#evidence-rationale` and `#voting-discussion`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="UMA Vote">
    After the debate period, UMA token holders vote on the correct outcome. The voting process takes approximately 48 hours.

    | Outcome           | Result                                 | Bond Distribution                                                                                        |
    | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Proposer wins** | Original proposal accepted             | Proposer gets bond back + half of disputer's bond                                                        |
    | **Disputer wins** | Proposal rejected, new proposal needed | Disputer gets bond back + half of proposer's bond                                                        |
    | **Too Early**     | Event hasn't concluded yet             | Disputer gets bond back + half of proposer's bond                                                        |
    | **Unknown/50-50** | Neither outcome applicable (rare)      | Market resolves 50/50 — each token redeems for \$0.50; disputer gets bond back + half of proposer's bond |
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Resolution

Once a market resolves:

* **Trading stops** — You can no longer buy or sell tokens for this market
* **Winning tokens** become redeemable for \$1.00 each
* **Losing tokens** become worthless (\$0.00)

### Redeeming Tokens

After resolution, call the `redeemPositions` function on the CTF contract to exchange winning tokens for USDC.e. The contract burns your tokens and returns the corresponding collateral.

```
100 winning tokens → $100 USDC.e
```

## Clarifications

In rare cases, unforeseen circumstances require clarification of the rules after trading begins. Polymarket may issue an **"Additional context"** update that proposers and voters should consider during resolution.

Clarifications:

* Cannot change the fundamental intent of the question
* Are published onchain via the bulletin board contract
* Should be considered by UMA voters when resolving disputes

<Tip>
  If you believe a clarification is needed, request it in the [Polymarket
  Discord](https://discord.com/invite/polymarket) `#market-review` channel.
</Tip>

## Resolution Timeline

| Phase                       | Duration    |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| Challenge period            | 2 hours     |
| Debate period (if disputed) | 24-48 hours |
| UMA voting (if disputed)    | \~48 hours  |

**Undisputed resolution**: \~2 hours after proposal

**Disputed resolution**: 4-6 days total
